<h3>An alternative approach to setuid or setgid bits. Capabilities</h3>
<p>A feature started off with kernel 2.2, which divides the privileges associated with a superuser or an equivalent into distinct components(capabilities), which are a per-thread attribute, so that the process or thread won't bypass all kernel permissions checks unnecessarily, i.e. to effectively reduce the damage caused if any of the capabilities are compromised. Refer "<b>man capabilities</b>" for capabilities list.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Inorder to fully implement capabilities, kernel must check whether the thread has required capability, also system calls should be provided to change and retrieve a thread's capabilities, plus the filesystem should support attaching capabilities to an executable.</li>
    <li>If possible avoid "<b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b>", which constitutes most of the capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <b>thread</b> has four capability sets containing zero or more capabilities.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">

    <li style="padding-top: 5px;">Before ambient sets were introduced a non-user couldn't run an executable with capabilities set, since F(inheritable) = 0. Now it can assigned to the ambient set which can perform the operation which was meant to be done by the inheritable set.</li>
    <h3>File capabilities</h3>
    <li><b>Permitted</b> : </li>
    <hr style="margin-top: 15px;">
    <li style="padding-top: 10px;"><b style="color: green;">Purpose of <i>process</i> permitted and effective set</b> : This set can act like a buffer to store all capabilities when that particular capability is not in use (i.e. if that particular capability is not in the <b>effective</b> set) by a process. Dropping a capability from effective set is analogous to the temporarily changing the EUID from 0 to non-zero ID, whereas the SUID holds the "0" while EUID is set non-zero. Here the EUID can be compared to the effective set and SUID to permittive set.  Also permitted set acts as an upper bound of capabilities. </li> 
    <li style="padding-top: 10px;"><b style="color: green;">Purpose of <i>file</i> permitted set and effective bit</b> : File permitted set acts a set of capbilities which that executable can attain while it is being executed (by follwing the transformation of capabilities algorithm). Whereas the effective bit is useful for <b>capability-dumb</b> programs, where the capabilities in the permitted set will be automatically added to effective set, for capability aware program, it internally make capget() and capset() calls to add it to the effective set. In case of <b>capability aware</b> programs, it can be made useful; without setting this bit, after an exec() call the new process won't be having any capabilities <b>initially </b>, the parent process had, which need to be acquired by system calls.</li>
</ul>

<p style="color: red; font-size: 19px; font-weight: bold;">RANDOM stuffs. (Men at work...)</p>

<p>
    If a set-user-ID-root program is executed (or if real/effective uid is 0) : All the <b>file</b> capabilities are enabled (i.e. both <b>file</b> inheritable and <b>file</b> permitted sets are filled with ones), also <b>effective bit</b> is set to 1. This is done to support legacy mode of execution (legacy fixup mode). When program switches it ID from non-zero to 0, then its effective set is cleared.
</p>

<p>Any capabilities given in the <b>file permitted set</b> can be set to <i>inheritable set</i> and <i>permitted set</i> of a process, using the <code>cap_set_flag()</code> and <code>cap_set_proc()</code> functions.</p>
